# Xamarin.Forms 4

Latest features available in [Xamarin.Forms 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.0/4.0.0-sr4) have been added as [Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/) navigation with routes and query parameters, and we added the new [CollectionView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/collectionview/) control to show the different product list.



# TailwindTraders.UITests

There are some [Xamarin.UITests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/uitest/)  that are run in AppCenter to ensure the app works as expected. The UITests available have been designed with the best practices obtained from the experience of several developments in this way so we think it is a very good sample of how create UITests the good way.
